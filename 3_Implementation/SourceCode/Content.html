                <h4 style="color: rgb(46, 46, 138);"><abbr title="Rotary Internaional is the non political Organization, that serves humanity"> ROTARY INTERNATIONAL </abbr></h4>
                &nbsp Rotary International is an international service organization whose stated purpose is to bring together business and professional 
                leaders in order to provide humanitarian service and to advance goodwill and peace around the world
                This is a non-political and non-religious organization open to all. 
                There are over <strong>35,000 member clubs worldwide</strong>, with a membership of <strong>1.2 million individuals</strong>, known as Rotarians.<br>

                &nbsp The first Rotary Club was formed when attorney Paul P. Harris called together a meeting of three business 
                acquaintances in downtown Chicago, United States, at Harris's friend Gustave Loehr's office in the Unity Building on 
                Dearborn Street on February 23, 1905.<br><br>

                &nbsp Rotary International is governed by a board of directors composed of the international president, the president-elect, the general secretary, and 17 zone directors. 
                The nomination and the election of each president is handled in the one- to three-year period before he or she takes office, 
                and is based on requirements including geographical balance among Rotary zones and previous service as a district governor and board member. 
                The international board meets quarterly to establish policies and make recommendations to the overall governing bodies, the RI Convention and the RI Council on Legislation.

                <h4 style="color: rebeccapurple;">Rotary Clubs</h4>
                &nbsp The Rotary Club is the basic unit of Rotary activity, and each club determines its own membership. 
                Clubs originally were limited to a single club per city, municipality, or town, 
                but Rotary International has encouraged the formation of one or more additional clubs in the largest cities when practical.
                Each club elects its own president and officers among its active members for a one-year term. The clubs enjoy considerable autonomy 
                within the framework of the standard constitution and the constitution and bylaws of Rotary International<br>

                <h4 style="color: rebeccapurple;">Rotaract Clubs</h4>
                &nbsp<abbr title="Rotry partner club, for youth">Rotaract</abbr> is an organization of young adults (university age and young professionals) 
                who take action through community and international service, learn leadership skills, and participate in professional development. 
                Rotaract clubs are either community or university based. "Rotaract" stands for "Rotary in Action", and its motto is <strong>"Service Above Self"</strong>.
                In 2019, Rotaract went from being a program of Rotary International to being a membership type of Rotary International, elevating its status to resemble that of Rotary clubs.

                &nbsp The Rotaract clubs are supervised as levels namely, <abbr title="Approximately 15 Rotary districts form a zone. A zone director, who serves as a member of the RI board of directors, heads two zones">District Level</abbr>
